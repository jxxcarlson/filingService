\title{Towards a LaTeX IDE for the Web}

\maketitle

\tableofcontents

This app is a work-in-progress demonstration of the
pure Elm text editor that I have been working on for
a while. Although more work is needed, it can
already do some useful thing: documents can be
written in MiniLaTeX (a subset/variant of LaTeX),
MathMarkdown (a flavor of Markdown that can render
LaTeX-style formulas), and plain text.

$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \pi
$$

When the editor is in good shape, it will become
part of
\href{https://minilatex.lamdera.app}{minilatex.lamdera.app}.
I hope that it will find other uses as well.

\section{Command execution}

One new feature of note is \blue{command
execution}.
As an example, try this: type ESC, then
"th", then ESC again. You should see a dummy theorem
environment in the source text. Replace the "XXX"
that you see with whatever you like.

Other things to try with ESC are \code{eq}, a dollar
or double dollar sign, as well as \code{enum} and
\code{item}. I'll be adding other environments as I
continue to work on the app. Also, if you would like
to experiment, press ctrl-option-C to clear the editor
and rendered text. Then have at it!


\section{Other features}

\strong{New documents.} Use the \blue{New document} button in the footer
to create a new document. In the popup window,
you can choose the document format


\strong{Files.} Files on disk can be opened, edited.


\strong{Footer.} Note the other buttons in the footer:
Open, Export, Save, and PDF: \italic{open
files on disk, export
MiniLaTeX files to standard LaTeX, save as MiniLaTeX,
and generate PDF.} (Try the PDF button now).


\strong{Demo files.} Note the buttons in the footer
on the extreme right. Clicking on them will load a file
into the editor.  As a bonus, the app can render
Markdown docs (along with LaTeX-style formulas).

\strong{More info.} For more info, press the \blue{Help} button in the
header.  Do note the various key commands.  They
work OK for Mac users, but I need to have an
alternative keymap for Linux and Windows users.
Suggestions are hereby solicited!

\section{Known bugs}

Lists in LaTeX are not always rendered properly.
An artefact of the way text is stored ... I'm
woking on it.

\section{Feedback}

Writing an editor is a complex undertaking.  I need
feedback on what doesn't work and what is missing.
Please see my contact info below.  Posting issues
on Github is welcome, but Slack, Email, and Twitter
also work.

\section{Contact}

Do contact me if you have questions, bug reports, etc.
There is a lot to do! The idea is to end up with a real
IDE for LaTeX on the web. When the editor project is
a little further along, I'll use is as the editor for
\href{https://minilatex.lamdera.app}{minilatex.lamdera.app}.
