# Issues

- When adding text at end of document, the visible 
window does not track the cursor.

- Should be able to shift-click to select text

- **option-D** in light mode does not return app to 
dark mode.

- In Markdown, need a no-table-of-contents option.

- Do not change color of visited items in table of 
contents.

- Add Markdown option for numbered headings.

- More robust conversion to LaTeX: markdown is good 
for rough drafts.
